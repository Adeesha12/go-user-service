# Gin specific files (if any temporary or build files are generated)
# Typically, Gin itself doesn't generate files that need to be ignored,
# but if you have specific temporary directories for uploads, sessions, etc.,
# you would add them here.
# Example:
# /tmp_uploads/
# /sessions/

# Go module cache
# This is usually located outside the project directory, but if you have
# a custom setup, you might need to ignore it.
# go.mod.bak
# go.sum.bak

# Any other project-specific temporary files
